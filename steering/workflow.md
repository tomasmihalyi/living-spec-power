# Living Spec Workflow

How to create, execute, and maintain Living Specs.

## Activation

This workflow activates when:
- User says "Create a Living Spec"
- User starts a new project and chooses Living Spec approach
- User requests to add a Living Spec to existing project

## Creating a Living Spec

### Step 1: Determine Scope

- **Project-level** (recommended): `project.living.md` - covers entire project
- **Domain-level**: `payments.living.md` - bounded context in large project
- **Feature-level**: `ml-pipeline.living.md` - complex standalone feature

### Step 2: Create File

Location: `.kiro/specs/[name].living.md`

Use template from: #[[file:steering/template.md]]

### Step 3: Detect Workspace

**Greenfield:**
- Set `Project Type: Greenfield`
- Skip Project Context section

**Brownfield:**
- Set `Project Type: Brownfield`
- Fill Project Context with current state
- Scan for existing Kiro specs to reference

## Phase Execution

### 🔵 Planning Phase

**Purpose:** WHAT to build and WHY

**Sections:** 1. Intent, 2. Requirements, 3. Architecture

**Execute:**
1. Fill Intent (problem, hypothesis, success criteria, scope)
2. Generate requirements questions in spec file (not chat)
3. Wait for user to fill Answer column
4. Document architecture decisions with timestamps
5. Get approval for each major decision

**Completion criteria:**
- Intent complete with measurable success criteria
- All requirements questions answered
- Architecture decisions approved

### 🟢 Building Phase

**Purpose:** HOW to build it

**Sections:** 4. Implementation, 5. Metrics (targets)

**Execute:**
1. Create execution plan with stages
2. Update stage status as work progresses (⬚ → 🔄 → ✅)
3. Add components to Component Map
4. Track technical debt with triggers
5. Set metric targets before deployment

**Completion criteria:**
- All execution plan stages complete
- Tests passing
- Ready for deployment

### 🟡 Operating Phase

**Purpose:** Deploy, monitor, iterate

**Sections:** 5. Metrics (current), 6. Decision Log, 7. Next Actions

**Execute:**
1. Deploy and track status
2. Fill current values in Metrics
3. Validate assumptions with evidence
4. Log decisions and outcomes
5. Plan iterations based on learnings

## Phase Transitions

**CRITICAL: Never auto-transition. Always ask for approval.**

### Planning → Building

1. Present summary:
   ```
   🔵 Planning Complete
   - Intent: [summary]
   - Requirements: [X] questions answered
   - Architecture: [Y] decisions approved
   
   Ready to proceed to Building?
   ```
2. Wait for explicit approval
3. Update header: `Phase: 🟢 Building`
4. Log transition in Decision Log with timestamp

### Building → Operating

1. Present summary:
   ```
   🟢 Building Complete
   - Stages: [X/Y] complete
   - Tests: Passing
   
   Ready to deploy and proceed to Operating?
   ```
2. Wait for explicit approval
3. Update header: `Phase: 🟡 Operating`
4. Log transition in Decision Log with timestamp

## Session Continuity

### Resuming Work

When returning to existing Living Spec:

1. Read header for current phase and status
2. Load context from completed sections
3. Present:
   ```
   Welcome back!
   - Phase: [Phase]
   - Stage: [Stage]
   - Next Action: [Action]
   
   A) Continue where you left off
   B) Review a previous section
   C) Check Kiro spec statuses
   ```
4. Wait for user choice

### Maintaining State

Keep Current Status updated:
```markdown
## Current Status
- **Next Action**: [What to do next]
- **Blockers**: [Any blockers]
- **Last Completed**: [Last completed stage]
```

## Updating the Spec

### When to Update Each Section

| Section | Update When |
|---------|-------------|
| 1. Intent | Goals change, scope shifts, new failure triggers |
| 2. Requirements | New Kiro spec created, spec phase changes |
| 3. Architecture | New decisions, tech stack changes |
| 4. Implementation | Stages complete, components added, debt introduced |
| 5. Metrics | New measurements, targets adjusted |
| 6. Decision Log | Any significant decision, phase transitions |
| 7. Next Actions | Tasks complete, priorities change |

### Decision Logging

Always include:
- ISO timestamp (e.g., `2024-12-24T10:30:00Z`)
- Phase context
- Approval status

### Kiro Spec Phase Updates

Update Related Kiro Specs table when:
- New Kiro spec created → add with 🔵 Planning
- Spec moves to tasks.md → update to 🟢 Building
- Feature deployed → update to 🟡 Operating

## Error Handling

### Incomplete Section at Transition

1. Identify missing elements
2. Present what's missing
3. Ask: complete or skip?
4. Log decision

### Spec Conflicts with Code

1. Identify conflict
2. Present both versions
3. Ask which is correct
4. Update incorrect source
5. Log resolution

### Recovery from Interruption

1. Read header for last known state
2. Check Audit Trail for last action
3. Resume from last checkpoint
4. Ask user to verify before continuing

## Adaptive Depth

Match depth to complexity:

| Complexity | Intent | Questions | Architecture | Execution |
|------------|--------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Simple | Brief | 3-5 | 1-2 decisions | 3-5 stages |
| Moderate | Full | 5-10 | Multiple | 5-10 stages |
| Complex | Complete | 10+ | Comprehensive | Multi-phase |

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Duplicating task tracking** - Track phases in Living Spec, tasks in Kiro specs
❌ **Auto-transitioning phases** - Always wait for explicit approval
❌ **Skipping timestamps** - Always include ISO timestamps
❌ **Deleting history** - Mark decisions as superseded, don't delete
❌ **Vague updates** - Be specific: "Added auth service" not "Updated implementation"
